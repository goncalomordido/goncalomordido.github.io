<h3>Biography</h3>

<p>Gonçalo Mordido is concluding his Ph.D. studies at the Hasso Plattner Institute and is an incoming postdoctoral fellow at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and Polytechnique Montreal. His research focuses on efficiently training machine learning models by leveraging algorithm-hardware co-design. During his doctoral studies, he has interned at NVIDIA twice, having received the NVIDIA Recognition Award for his research contributions. Gonçalo obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science Engineering at NOVA University of Lisbon in 2015 and 2017, respectively.</p>
